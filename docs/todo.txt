	BUGS

	? profile arc offset does not account for acute angles
	? exe gets stuck when bad command is entered during hold
	? goto with nan produces the wrong feed rate

	X CCW curve flips the arc horizontally (propagate fix throughout)
	X square pocket with inner dimensions and zero offset not working
	X exe fails when you pass a directory
	X ramp not working for linear diagonal
	X fillet does not work with new circle system
	X bore kills program

	REFACTORING

	- standardized all data types to <stdint.h>
	- Point2 and Point3

	UI

	- current coordinates display
	- script mode (display current last and next lines)

	CONTROL

	- bulk compile actions into linked list
	- ramping based on inertia
	- jog mode
	- repeat command
	- probing sequence / scripts
	- programmable ramp rate
	X programmable table run out compensator
	X multi-line skip
	
	CAM	

	- engrave
	- auto feed, plunge, and inc calculator
	  - predefined materials (load like tools)
	  - define number of fluids in tool file
	  - compute from feature dimensions and chip load
	- tool cutting length check
	- dynamic clearance height or automatic check
	X subroutine layers profile
	X drill pecking
	X improved multi-axis feed rate estimate
	X optimal direction square pocket
	
	SCRIPTING

	- script check
  	- print error string for invalid scripting command
	- multi-line comment
	X basic add/sub expressions
        X scripting variables
	X allow for extra white space
